# 2.To-do-list

## Description
- This To-Do List project allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It provides the following features:
  - Add new tasks.
  - Mark tasks as completed.
  - Remove tasks independently from one another.
  - A button to delete all tasks that are marked as completed.

- The application uses localStorage to save:
  - The user's selected theme (Dark or Light mode).
  - The user's task list, allowing it to be reloaded when they return to the page.

- This ensures that the user’s preferences and tasks are retained even after they leave and come back to the page.
